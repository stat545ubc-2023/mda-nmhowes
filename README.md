The Markdown (md) files can be opened on the GitHub web interface or downloaded.

In the mda-nmhowes.md file, the results of running R code are also displayed within the file. Of course, you can also copy the code and manually input it into the R console to verify the results. You can also open a new project on R studio by coping the link to our project on Github, opening a new project on R studio, and pasting the link. You can then knit the document to see the results.
