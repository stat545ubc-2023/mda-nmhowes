# Mini Data Analysis Milestone 1 + 2
#### This repository is for Milestone 1 + 2 of the Mini Data Analysis project for STAT 545. 
### __Introduction__
This data analysis investigates different data sets with an emphasis on the "Vancouver Trees" dataset which includes information regarding tree species, location, and dimentions in Vancouver. 

This analysis demonstrates the ability to use various dplyr functions, model fitting, tidy data and ggplot to investigate different relationships between varibles in datasets as well as summarize and manipulate data. 

### Files in Project Folder

mda-milestone1: This folder pertains to the mini data analysis milestone 1 which includes the mda-nmhowes03.Rmd, mda-nmhowes03.mda and mda-nmhowes03_files/figure-gfm which includes the figures generated on R.

mda-milestone2: This folder pertains to the mini data analysis milestone 2 which includes the mda-nmhowes_FINAL_.Rmd, mda-nmhowes_FINAL_.mda and mda-nmhowes_FINAL_files/figure-gfm which includes the figures generated on R.

Output: This folder pertains to the mini data analysis milestone 2 which includes a Task4.csv and my_fit.rds which were generated in the analysis.

### How to Run Code in Files 

The Markdown (md) file can be viewed on the GitHub web interface or downloaded in apps that can open .md files. 

In the mda-nmhowes03.md or file, mda-nmhowes_FINAL_.md the running R code can be found which can be copied into R to test. The link to this analysis on Github can also be used by starting a new project in R studio and pasting that link. 

You can also open a new project on R studio by coping the link to our project on Github, opening a new project on R studio, and pasting the link. You can then knit the document to see the results.
